# Software Rasterizer
This project is an implementation of a simple CPU rasterizer in Rust. The project was inspired by Sebastian Lague, and it follows his video [Sebastian Lague - Coding Adventure: Software Rasterizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyJ-hdISgnw).

The rust project is structured based on the [dev.to blog post by Ghost](https://dev.to/ghost/rust-project-structure-example-step-by-step-3ee), which shows how Rust projects can be structured.

Lastly, the project is backed by Git and follows the [GitFlow branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) defined by Vincent Driessen
